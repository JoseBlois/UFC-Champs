            <h2>UFC career</h2>
            <p>A 16-0 record in the regional circuits of Russia and Ukraine was enough to get a call up from the <abbr title="Ultimate Fighter Championship"> UFC</abbr>. Later, Khabib's father revealed in an interview that due to a contract dispute with ProFC they had 11 court cases contesting the legitimacy of Khabib's <abbr title="Ultimate Fighter Championship"> UFC</abbr> contract. After losing six and winning five cases, they reached an agreement and Khabib was able to continue his career</p>

             <h3> UFC Debut</h3>
             <p>
                In late 2011, Nurmagomedov signed a six-fight deal to compete in the UFC's lightweight division.
                In his <abbr title="Ultimate Fighter Championship"> UFC</abbr> debut, on 20 January 2012 at <abbr title="Ultimate Fighter Championship"> UFC</abbr> on FX 1, Nurmagomedov defeated Kamal Shalorus via submission in the third round
             </p>
            </section>
             <h3>Title fight</h3>
             <p>
                A bout with Ferguson had been scheduled for the fourth time and was expected to take place on 7 April 2018 at <abbr title="Ultimate Fighter Championship"> UFC</abbr> 223. However, on 1 April 2018, it was reported that Ferguson had injured his knee and was to be replaced by Max Holloway. On 6 April, Holloway was pulled from the fight after the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) declared him unfit to compete due to extreme weight cutting, and replaced by Al Iaquinta. Only Nurmagomedov was eligible to win the championship, as Iaquinta weighed in 0.2 pounds over the championship weight limit. Nurmagomedov dominated the fight, controlling Iaquinta from start to finish, and won via unanimous decision to become the <abbr title="Ultimate Fighter Championship"> UFC</abbr> Lightweight Champion.
